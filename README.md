# 🔐 Software Security Requirements Baseline

Welcome to the Software Security Requirements Baseline Repository

This repository is a compendium of cybersecurity requirements and specifications that I have collected, curated, and developed throughout my career in Product Security. It is meant to serve as a practical and adaptable foundation for embedding security into systems from the ground up


## 📘 Purpose

This repository aims to provide developers, architects, and security professionals with:

1. A baseline of well-structured functional security requirements
2. The rationale behind each requirement to clarify intent and value
3. Supporting specifications and design guidance (when applicable)
4. Testing tips to validate proper implementation


## ⚠️ Please Note

Not all requirements in this repository will be directly applicable to every system! Security is highly context-dependent. You are encouraged to adapt or extend these requirements to fit the nature, architecture, and threat model of your own application or platform
