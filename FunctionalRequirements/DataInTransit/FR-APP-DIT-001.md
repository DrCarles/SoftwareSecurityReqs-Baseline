### 📌 Requirement
**The application must restrict access to communication endpoints, exposing them only through authorized interfaces**


### 💡 Rationale 

Limiting the exposure of communication endpoints helps reduce the system’s attack surface by ensuring that only intended users and components can interact with the application. Unnecessary or publicly exposed endpoints, such as debug interfaces, can become entry points for attackers
