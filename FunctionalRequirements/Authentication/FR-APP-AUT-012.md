### 📌 Requirement
**The system must re-authenticate the user before allowing any security-sensitive action**


### 💡 Rationale 
Re-authentication adds an extra layer of protection when users perform security-sensitive actions such as changing a password, generating API keys, or modifying critical settings. This helps prevent unauthorized actions by an attacker who may have hijacked an active session or gained access to an unattended device, ensuring that the user's identity is verified before proceeding 


### ⚙️ Specifications
