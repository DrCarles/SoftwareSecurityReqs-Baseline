### 📌 Requirement
**The system should support two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance account security during user login**


### 💡 Rationale 
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) helps protect users even if their password is stolen. To impersonate a user, an attacker would need not only the password but also a second factor, such as a code from an app or a hardware token, making unauthorized access much more difficult
