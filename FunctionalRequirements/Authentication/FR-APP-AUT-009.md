### 📌 Requirement
**The system must implement protection mechanisms against user enumeration**


### 💡 Rationale 
User enumeration vulnerabilities allow attackers to determine whether a specific username, email address, or account exists in the system, typically by analyzing error messages or response behavior. This information can be used to target users with phishing attacks or brute-force attempts. By implementing protection mechanisms the system helps prevent attackers from identifying valid user accounts


### ⚙️ Specifications 

- 📘 The system must provide generic error messages for invalid login attempts

- 📘 The system must provide consistent response time for invalid login attempts


### 🧪 Testing tips 
Suggested test steps for verifying this requirement:
1. Try login into the system with an invalid username
2. Try login into the system with valid username and invalid credentials
3. Check that the error messages of Step #1 and Step #2 are identical
4. Check that the response time of Step #1 and Step #2 are identical
