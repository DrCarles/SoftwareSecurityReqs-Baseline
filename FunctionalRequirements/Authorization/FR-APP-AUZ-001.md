### 📌 Requirement
**Authorization must be enforced at the business logic layer, not just in the presentation layer**


### 💡 Rationale 
Relying on presentation-layer controls (like UI elements) to enforce authorization is insecure, as these can be bypassed by manipulating requests directly, specially in web applications. Implementing authorization checks in the business logic layer ensures that access control is consistently applied, regardless of how the request is made


### ⚙️ Specifications
