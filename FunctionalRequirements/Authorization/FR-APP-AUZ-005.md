### 📌 Requirement
**Default application permission configuration must follow the principles of least privilege and separation of duties**


### 💡 Rationale 
By applying the principle of least privilege, users and components are granted only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. Separation of duties ensures that no single role has unchecked control over critical operations, reducing the risk of abuse, error, or insider threats. Together, these principles strengthen the overall security posture of the system
