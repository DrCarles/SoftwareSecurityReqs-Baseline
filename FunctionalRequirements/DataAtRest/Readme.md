This section contains a set of cybersecurity requirements specifically related to data stored in persistent systems, such as databases, file systems, backups, and local storage

2. Data Theft or Breach: If storage systems are compromised, unencrypted data may be stolen and exfiltrated, leading to data breaches

3. Insider Threats: Employees or administrators with unnecessary access to stored data may misuse or leak it, either intentionally or accidentally
