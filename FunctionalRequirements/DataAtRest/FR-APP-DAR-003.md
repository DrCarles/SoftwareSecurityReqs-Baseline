### 📌 Requirement

**The application must provide a data backup and restore mechanism**


### 💡 Rationale 

Data loss can occur due to system failures, human errors, malware attacks (such as ransomware), or hardware issues. A robust backup and restore mechanism ensures that critical data can be recovered and operations can resume in the event of accidental deletion, corruption, or catastrophic failure

- 📘 The application must backup all data, including configuration settings

- 📘 The application must allow configuring the backup cadence  

- 📘 Backups must be regularly tested for restoration
