### 📌 Requirement

**The application must sanitize all outgoing data before transmitting it to external systems, ensuring it does not contain executable or unsafe content**


### 💡 Rationale 

Output sanitization is critical to protecting users and systems from a range of attacks, particularly Cross-Site Scripting, and data leakage vulnerabilities. Even if data is safely stored, it may become dangerous when reflected back to users, especially if it includes user-generated content or inputs from untrusted sources

By sanitizing output, the application ensures that executable content such as HTML, JavaScript, or CSS is properly escaped or removed before reaching the frontend. This helps prevent the accidental exposure of sensitive internal data and makes it significantly harder for attackers to exploit reflected or stored vulnerabilities. It also protects against threats like session hijacking, unauthorized actions, and data exfiltration
