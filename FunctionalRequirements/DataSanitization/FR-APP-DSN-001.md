### 📌 Requirement
**The application must perform input validation on all incoming data**


### 💡 Rationale 

Input validation is a fundamental security control that helps protect the application from a wide range of attacks and errors caused by unexpected or malicious input. By verifying that all inputs conform to defined rules, the system can prevent: injection attacks, data corruption and processing errors, denial of service, and unauthorized access attempts

Validating inputs at the earliest point possible, preferably both on the client and server sides, ensures that only safe, well-formed data enters the system


### ⚙️ Specifications 

- 📘 The application must enforce input validation at server-side 

- 📘 The application should enforce input validation at client-side 

- 📘 The application should perform strict input validation on all incoming data to ensure it meets expected formats, types, and constraints before processing

- 📘 The application must blacklist dangerous characters and strings
