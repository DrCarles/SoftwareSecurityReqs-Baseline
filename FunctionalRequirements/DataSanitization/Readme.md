## ðŸ”‘ Data Sanitization Requirements

This section contains cybersecurity requirements focused on properly sanitizing input and output data to protect the system from injection attacks and data corruption


### ðŸŒ© Common Risks:

Failing to properly sanitize data can lead to several serious security issues, including:

1. Injection Attacks: Unsanitized inputs can allow attackers to inject malicious code, such as SQL injection, command injection, or cross-site scripting, compromising system integrity and confidentiality

2. Data Corruption: Improperly handled data may cause application errors or corrupt stored information, leading to unexpected behavior or loss of data integrity

3. Cross-Site Scripting: Unsanitized output displayed on user interfaces can allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in usersâ€™ browsers, leading to session hijacking or data theft

4. Denial of Service: Maliciously crafted inputs may overwhelm system resources or trigger application crashes if not properly validated and sanitized

5. Unauthorized Access or Privilege Escalation: Injection flaws can allow attackers to bypass authentication or escalate privileges within the system
