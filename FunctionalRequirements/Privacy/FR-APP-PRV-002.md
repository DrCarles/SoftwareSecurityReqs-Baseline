### 📌 Requirement
**The system must implement proper data lifecycle management**


### 💡 Rationale 
Sensitive data should be retained only for as long as necessary to meet the system’s business objectives and regulatory requirements. Limiting the retention period of sensitive data reduces the risk of data breaches and minimizes the potential impact of security incidents. Storing data longer than needed increases the risk and legal exposure, often without providing additional value


### ⚙️ Specifications 

- 📘 The system should provide configurable data retention policies, allowing administrators to define how long sensitive data is kept based on business and regulatory needs


### 🧪 Testing tips 
For each type of data storage, verify that sensitive data is automatically deleted once it is no longer needed. Ensure the configured retention settings are being enforced correctly, and that expired data is properly purged from databases, backups, and logs
