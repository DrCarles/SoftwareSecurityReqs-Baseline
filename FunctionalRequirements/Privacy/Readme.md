## üîë Privacy Requirements

This section contains a set of cybersecurity requirements specifically related to data privacy


### üå© Common Risks:

Privacy requirements are designed to prevent the following common risks by default:

1. Sensitive Data Leakage: Unauthorized exposure of personally identifiable information, financial records, health data, or other sensitive user data

2. Regulatory Non-Compliance: Failure to meet legal obligations under data protection regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, or other local privacy laws. Non-compliance can result in fines, legal penalties, and reputational damage

3. Excessive Data Collection: Gathering more personal data than is necessary for the system‚Äôs function, increasing legal exposure and creating a larger attack surface for potential breaches

4. Inadequate Data Retention Policies: Storing personal data longer than needed, which can violate regulations and increase the risk of unauthorized access over time

5. Lack of Data Subject Control: Not supporting user rights such as access, correction, or deletion of personal data (e.g., ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù) can erode trust and lead to legal challenges

6. Improper Data Disposal: Failing to securely delete or sanitize data at the end of its lifecycle can leave it recoverable by malicious actors, especially in shared or reused storage environments


### üìå Requirements:
- [Data minimization](FR-APP-PRV-001.md)
- [Data lifecyle management](FR-APP-PRV-002.md)
- [Right to erasure](FR-APP-PRV-003.md)
- [Secure data disposal](FR-APP-PRV-004.md)
