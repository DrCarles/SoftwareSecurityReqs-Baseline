### 📌 Requirement

**The system must securely delete data when it is no longer needed, ensuring it cannot be recovered**


### 💡 Rationale 

Secure data disposal is essential to prevent unauthorized recovery of sensitive information after it is no longer required. Simply deleting a file or database entry is often insufficient, as data may still be retrievable from storage media, logs, backups, or caches

Improper data disposal increases the risk of data leakage, especially when devices are repurposed, decommissioned, or compromised. Secure disposal techniques help ensure that personal, confidential, or regulated data is permanently and irreversibly removed
